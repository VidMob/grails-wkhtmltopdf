= Grails wkhtmltopdf

This plugin provides an easy integration of `wkhtmltopdf`, a command line tool to render HTML into PDF.

This enables you to write a Grails View in HTML as usual, but render as PDF.

== Wkhtmltopdf
`wkhtmltopdf` and `wkhtmltoimage` are open source (LGPLv3) command line tools to render HTML into PDF and various image formats using the Qt WebKit rendering engine.
These run entirely "headless" and do not require a display or display service. +
http://wkhtmltopdf.org/

== Installation

In addition to adding the plugin as dependency to your Grails project, the `wkhtmltopdf` binary must be installed.
See instructions at http://wkhtmltopdf.org/ or install using your package manager (apt-get, yum, brew etc)

Finally make sure the following command works as expected:

    wkhtmltopdf www.google.com test.pdf


== Configuration

Put the following line into your `application.groovy` (or corresponding property in `application.yml`) and adjust the path to your wkhtmltopdf binary (`which wkhtmltopdf`)

    grails.plugin.wkhtmltopdf.binary = "/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf"

Typical paths:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|OS
|Path

|OS X
|/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf

|Linux
|/usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf

|Windows
|C:/local/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf.exe

== Usage

To stream the content of a Controller-action as PDF just call `/some/someAction.pdf`

[source,groovy]
----
class SomeController {
    def someAction() {
        def someInstance = SomeDomainObject.get(params.id)

        render( filename:"File ${someInstance.id}.pdf",
                view:"/some/someGspTemplate",
                model:[someInstance:someInstance],
                header:"/pdf/someHeader",
                footer:"/pdf/someFooter",
                marginLeft:20,
                marginTop:35,
                marginBottom:20,
                marginRight:20,
                headerSpacing:10)
    }
}
----

Or create binary PDF data and use them for any other purpose

[source,groovy]
----
class SomeService {

    static transactional = false

    def doSomething() {
        def byte[] pdfData = wkhtmltoxService.makePdf(
                view: "/pdf/someGspTemplate",
                model: [someInstance: someInstance],
                header: "/pdf/someHeader",
                footer: "/pdf/someFooter",
                marginLeft: 20,
                marginTop: 35,
                marginBottom: 20,
                marginRight: 20,
                headerSpacing: 10)


        // DO Something e.g. send as mail
        //sendAsynchronousMail {
        //    multipart true
        //    to "mail@mail.de"
        //    subject "see PDF Attachment";
        //    attachBytes "PDF Attachment.pdf", "application/pdf", pdfData
        //    body "see my pdf attachment"
        //}
    }
}
